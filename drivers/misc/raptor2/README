This is a sample driver to show how we can initialize a device and make use of
regular interrupts.

Example of device tree node:

doorbell0: raptor2_doorbell@deadbeef {
	compatible = "raptor2,doorbell";
	reg = <0x00 0xdeadbeef 0x0 0x01>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 255 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL IRQ_DEFAULT_PRIORITY>;
	rbell-irq = <254>;
	cpu-affinity = <0>;
	label = "DOORBELL_0";
	status = "okay";
};

Configurations needed to enable driver:

CONFIG_RAPTOR2_DOORBELL=y
